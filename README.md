# Impact-of-ESG-performance-on-firm-value-and-profitability

## This project analyzes a large dataset to examine the impact of ESG performance on firm value and profitability, revealing that while Social and Governance factors significantly boost firm value, all three ESG dimensions—Environmental, Social, and Governance—positively contribute to firm profitability, reinforcing ESG as a driver of financial return.

### This project explores how a company’s Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance influences its financial success. Using real-world data, I conducted a thorough analysis to assess the correlation between ESG scores and key financial metrics such as profitability, return on equity, and market valuation.

## I applied data analytics techniques to:

### Analyze ESG performance data alongside financial indicators across multiple firms and industries.

### Identify trends and patterns linking strong ESG practices to higher profitability and improved firm value.

### Visualize insights to support business decision-making and investment strategy.

### Key takeaway: Companies with higher ESG ratings often demonstrate stronger financial performance, reduced risk exposure, and greater long-term value for stakeholders—making ESG not just a compliance effort, but a strategic business lever.

Abstract
In this study, we examine impact of Environment, Social, Governance (ESG) performance on firm value and profitability. Our large dataset gives us the chance to better conceptualize this impact. Our findings suggest that overall ESG combined score is positively and significantly associated with firm value. Individual Social and Governance scores have a positive and significant relationship while Environment score does not have a significant relationship with firm value. On the other hand, ESG combined score, Environment, Social, and Governance scores have positive and significant relationships with firm profitability. These findings suggest that investing in high ESG performance promises financial return for the firm in terms of both value and profitability.
