## ðŸ“Š Analysis Highlights
- Measured correlation between ESG scores and ROE, ROA, and firm valuation
- Regression models tested significance of each ESG pillar (E, S, G)
- Identified that Social and Governance scores had the strongest association with firm value
- Found all ESG dimensions contributed positively to firm profitability

## ðŸ’¡ Key Findings
- High ESG-rated companies tend to have stronger financial performance and lower risk
- Social and Governance initiatives are particularly impactful on valuation
- ESG can act as a strategic financial lever, not just a compliance measure

---

## ðŸ§  Tools and Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- ESG and financial datasets (public sources or proprietary)
